# Spam-email-filter-statistics
This was the final project for Virginia Tech's STAT 3516 Biostatistics Class. I was tasked with creating an accurate spam filter from a large (>250,000 data points) dataset created by HP Labs (the spam.csv file). I went through a number of models before selecting the last one in the data based on its low AIC value. It ended up being 94.29% accurate at a 95% confidence interval. This also includes a powerpoint presentation given to the class on the problem set. The overall grade acheived was a 92%.
